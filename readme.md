# R2-Dualsense2
This code implements three of my previous projects. Firstly, Sony's Dualsense controller is used for UI inputs within python. Second, animating open chained robotic linkages. Lastly, using a custom class for quick sylized UI development.

written in [Pure Python](https://github.com/BrianLesko/maze-runner/blob/main/app.py) in under 100 lines. Created by Brian Lesko for Learning Purposes.

## Dependencies

This code uses the following libraries:
- `streamlit`: for building the user interface.
- `numpy`: for creating arrays.
- `matplotlib`: for saving image data
- `io`: for saving image data
- `hidapi`: for accessing usb connections on the host device


&nbsp;

## Usage

Run the following commands:
```
pip install --upgrade streamlit hidapi matplotlib streamlit
streamlit run https://github.com/BrianLesko/maze-runner/blob/main/app.py
```

This will start the local Streamlit server, and you can access the chatbot by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.

&nbsp;

## How it Works

The app as follows:
1. The hidapi library is used to initiate a connection to the PS5 controller
2. The dualsense class is used to decode the received bytes
3. Scikit-learn is used to resize maze images
4. Streamlit is used to display the decoded bytes from the touchpad
5. If the touchpad pixel overlaps with a wall, you lose a life
6. If you reach the goal you make it to the next level
7. The app stops after a set number of loops
8. The user can download their artwork
